# PAO â€“ PowerOfThree

It started with three people, less than one month, and one big idea:  
to bring together **Bare Metal, Embedded Linux, and Android Automotive** into a single connected system.

This project is the harvest of 9 months at the ITI Embedded Systems Track.  
Thatâ€™s how **PAO â€“ The Power of Three** was born.

- **The Power of Three People**: Patrick Atef, Abdallah, and Omar.  
- **The Power of Three Systems**: Bare Metal + Yocto + AOSP.  

Together, we designed, coded, and integrated everything end-to-end into a **Tri-System Embedded Architecture** that bridges microcontrollers, embedded Linux, and Android Automotive into a secure, intelligent automotive platform.

##  System Architecture

### 1. Bare Metal Microcontrollers
- **ESP32** â†’ Secure fingerprint enrollment & authentication (SHA hashing).  
- **STM32 Bluepill** â†’ Reads potentiometers & push buttons, transmits real-time data via CAN.  

### 2. Embedded Linux (Yocto on Raspberry Pi 3B+)
- Custom **Yocto layer (meta-pao)** with integrated **vsomeip**.  
- **Qt6 cluster UI** shows STM32 sensor data (CAN) & ESP32 fingerprint events (UART).  
- **systemd services** auto-launch the Qt6 app at startup.  
- Acts as the **central bridge node** between Bare Metal and Android Automotive.  

### 3. AOSP (Android Automotive on Raspberry Pi 5 â€“ 16 GB RAM)
- Customized **AOSP 15** build with direct **VHAL integration**.  
- **vsomeip inside VHAL** â†’ event-driven communication with Yocto.  
- **Kotlin Passenger App** with:  
  - HVAC multi-zone control  
  - Ambient lighting zones  
  - Media & music playback  
  - Voice assistant (Vosk)  
  - GPS navigation  
  - Secure OTA updates (SHA verification)  
  - Child Mode â†’ multi-user profiles via OpenCV face detection

##  Key Innovations
- **End-to-End Security** â†’ Fingerprint & OTA updates protected with SHA hashing.  
- **vsomeip in Yocto & Android VHAL** â†’ Event-driven communication across systems.  
- **meta-pao Yocto Layer** â†’ Customized integration layer with automation (systemd).  
- **Qt6 Cluster UI** â†’ Real-time visualization of CAN data.  
- **Immersive Android Automotive Passenger App** â†’ Multi-zone HVAC, lighting, music, GPS & voice.
